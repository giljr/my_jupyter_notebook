Where I Embrace Playful Experimentation, offering you an scaffolding opportunities to Code, Hack, 
and Tinker too, and eventually you may *toss me some feedback* :blush:

Here, the emphasy lies on this motto of the Maker Movement: :art:
```
Learning By Doing!
``` 

I believe that the essential lessons can be learned about the systems - about the world - 
from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interenting things.

These are the [Levy, Steven(2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396)'s **Hackers Ethic** principles (that I've valued most):
* *Access to computer* - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always *yield to Hands-on Imperative*!
* *Hackers should be judged by their hacking*, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position;
* You can *create art and beauty* on a computer;
* Computer can *change your life for the better*.

Use 👉 [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb?hl=en_US) 👌 This is awesome, try it yourself!

>[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8iMbc-iQqlULW1HZXFiNnBEZUE) This gives you access to all the project's files. Please, search by # for artifacts, such as Code, Fritzing, Proteus, Schemas and more \o/
